- The project follows a clear separation of concerns:
  - **memory-bank/**: Contains all project documentation.
  - **src/**: Contains the primary source code.
  - **tests/**: Contains test files.
- The directory structure is modular and does not enforce any specific monorepo constraints, allowing flexibility and scalability.

Adopt consistent coding standards across all languages:
  
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
  - Adopt strict TypeScript configuration.
  - Naming Conventions:
    - PascalCase for classes and types.
    - camelCase for functions and variables.
  - Prefer named exports over default exports.
  
- **Python:**
  - Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
  - Use explicit, descriptive naming.
  - Prefer absolute import paths.
  
- **Shell Scripts:**
  - Use POSIX-compliant syntax.
  - Include comprehensive comments.
  - Avoid hardcoded paths when possible.

- Prioritize command-line tools for:
  - Project initialization.
  - Dependency management.
  - Script execution.
- Ensure operations are non-destructive, with clear step-by-step workflow:
  1. Update relevant documentation.
  2. Implement required changes.
  3. Run tests where applicable.
  4. Verify and commit changes.
